## ShowSlowly

A lite web version of [Slowly](https://www.getslowly.com/en/). Through it one can send or receive letters, check and update location. Since the official web version has also been released, I'd like to introduce some unique features embeded inside ShowSlowly:

- Check letters before arrival
- Show locations of your friends who allow to update location (Not available right now due to the banning from slowly)
- Change your location to reduce the travelling time of a letter
- Check past letters conveniently while writing a letter
- Send images as attachement without any permissions
- Count words precisely of each letter
- Show statistics of letters in different styles
- All functions work well on mobile broswers

**Note:** All data is fetched from Slowly's server and stored in browser's local storage. You should never leak any sensitive data like token or sms code to others.
